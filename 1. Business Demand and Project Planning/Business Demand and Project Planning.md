## Sample Business Request

Sales Manager:

"Hi Natalie!

I hope you are doing well. We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to <u>**visual dashboards**</u>.

Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have **sold of what products**, to **which clients** and **how it has been over time**.

Seeing as each **sales person** works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to **filter them** also.

We measure our numbers against **budget** so I added that in a **spreadsheet** so we can compare our values against performance. 

The budget is for 2021 and we usually look **2 years back** in time when we do analysis of sales.

Let me know if you need anything else!"
